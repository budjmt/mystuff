Well, it's not done. That should be said. We'll work on it.

Game Flow is as follows:
Player logs in, if there's no lobby, then they pick a map and start one. Then 3 others join that lobby. 
These 4 players are then distributed into 2 teams. One team keeps the macguffins away from the other for two minutes.
If the team succeeds, they win. If not, they lose and the other team wins. 
Then the players get logged out and prompted to log back in, including spectators who now have a chance to play.
