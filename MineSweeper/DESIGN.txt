Michael Cohen, Shanshan Chen

GOAL:
To make the game Minesweeper

INTERFACE:
Minesweeper interface, it's a graphical window that responds to clicks

USAGE:
It ALLOCATES MEMORY. Future builds would include FILE I/O for saving and reading high scores. There's also quite a bit of POINTER TOMFOOLERY

RESPONSIBILITIES:
Michael: Coding the thing
Shanshan: Design Doc and such (BUT IT'S 5 AM SO I'M DOING IT)

DATA STRUCTURES:
See below

ALGORITHMS:
See below

TIMELINE:
1/11/13 - The window creation and graphics aspects should be mostly figured out, and some of the underlying game should be working.
MISSED

1/18/13 - The game should be done, all that should be left is custom sized grids, that feature where the game searches out from where you've clicked, and bugs.
HAHA ARE YOU JOKING

1/25/13 - Game is sort of done, needs some bug fixes and a few more features.

Grid of mines (Pointer to a series of linked lists)
	mines are generated first, with -1 being the indicator
	after that, each square in the grid checks its neighbors and
	becomes the correct number.
Clicking functionality
	If a square has...
		A flag : nothing happens
		-1 : GAME OVER
		else : number is revealed
	Reset button
	If right click, toggle flag.
Timer
New Game
	On command line, three numbers, width, height, number of mines
	(Obviously, if mines > width * height, the game doesn't launch)
	Also, three defaults: 1, 8 by 8, 10 mines, 2, 16 by 16, 40
	mines, and 3, 30 by 16, 99 mines.
	Default if no number is added is 1.
	In game, only reset, different grid size must be launched 		separately.
Game End
	Either when a mine is clicked or the last non mine space is
	clicked
