#This is SpaceViper's sratchpad for brainstorming

Ideas
space shooter: bits where you shoot at alien ships
terrain exploration: fly free around a planet, find items, fight ships, etc.
-these sections would upgrade the ship [propulsion, heating [shoot time],
                                        speed of shots, powerup power, etc.]

Ship - The SpaceViper
-crappy vessel (relatively speaking) initially
-power-ups are emblems
-propulsion green rings thrown back the opposite direction of the ship; change
when ship turned
-Control:
    In planet portions, like asteroids
    In space shooters, maybe the same, maybe straightforward locked
-Power-up ideas:
    Centipede: Adds segments to your ship. These are extra hits.*
    Big Fangs: Increases your fang firepower/size.
    Rapid: Rapid fire.
    Turbo: Increases speed when used. Triggered by user. Drops diff. numbers.*
    Shield: Creates a temporary barrier that lasts 10 seconds.*

    *These can be standard abilities when unlocked
-Alternate Ships:
    Cosmic Anaconda: Joke ship from the description. Like the standard ship,
    but with alternate color pallate and propulsion.
    BOSS SHIPS: These would be the bosses ships. These would be very difficult
    to unlock, and lead to different story paths (you would face the SpaceViper)
