#This is SpaceViper's sratchpad for brainstorming

Ideas
space shooter: bits where you shoot at alien ships
terrain exploration: fly free around a planet, find items, fight ships, etc.
-these sections would upgrade the ship [propulsion, heating [shoot time],
                                        speed of shots, powerup power, etc.]

Ship - The SpaceViper
-crappy vessel (relatively speaking) initially
